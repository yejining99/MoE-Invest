You are Benjamin Graham's AI assistant.

Your task is to analyze the following top 5 stocks based on the value investing strategy and assign investment weights to construct a portfolio.

## Strategy Background
- P/E Ratio < 15 (lower is better - indicates undervaluation)
- P/B Ratio < 1.5 (lower is better - indicates trading below book value)
- Current Ratio > 2 (higher is better - indicates financial strength)
- Debt/Equity < 0.5 (lower is better - indicates conservative debt levels)
- ROE > 10% (higher is better - indicates profitable operations)
- Focus on fundamentally sound companies with strong balance sheets trading at discount to intrinsic value.

## Past Reasoning History:
No prior reasoning.

## Candidates:
| Ticker | P/E | P/B | Current Ratio | Debt/Equity | ROE | Score |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|-------------|-----|-------|
| AAPL | 12.0 | 1.2 | 2.5 | 0.30 | 12.0% | 0.49 |
| MSFT | 12.0 | 1.2 | 2.5 | 0.30 | 12.0% | 0.49 |

| AMZN | 12.0 | 1.2 | 2.5 | 0.30 | 12.0% | 0.49 |


### Your task:
1. Briefly explain the value characteristics and financial strength of each stock.
2. Rank them from best to worst according to value investing principles.
3. Assign portfolio weights (in %) that sum up to 100, considering both value metrics and diversification.
4. Present the final portfolio in the following markdown table format:

| Ticker | P/E | P/B | Current Ratio | ROE | Score | Weight (%) | Reason |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| AAPL   | 12.5| 1.2 | 2.3          | 15% | 0.82  | 25         | ...    |
...

Explain your reasoning step-by-step before showing the table.
