Your task is to analyze the following top 5 stocks based on the Deep Value + Momentum strategy and assign investment weights to construct a portfolio.

## Strategy Background
- Deep Value: Select stocks with low EV/EBIT ratios (cheapest 10-20%)
- Momentum Filter: Among value stocks, select those with positive momentum (top 30%)
- Volatility-adjusted momentum to account for risk
- Focus on undervalued companies showing recent strength
- Avoid value traps through momentum confirmation

## Past Reasoning History:
No prior reasoning.

## Candidates:
| Ticker | EV/EBIT | 12M Return | Volatility | Adj Momentum | Score |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| AAPL | 5.5 | 20.0% | 25.0% | 0.80 | 0.58 |
| MSFT | 5.5 | 20.0% | 25.0% | 0.80 | 0.58 |
| TSLA | 5.5 | 20.0% | 25.0% | 0.80 | 0.58 |
| NVDA | 5.5 | 20.0% | 25.0% | 0.80 | 0.58 |
| AMZN | 5.5 | 20.0% | 25.0% | 0.80 | 0.58 |


### Your task:
1. Analyze the value characteristics (EV/EBIT) and momentum of each stock.
2. Rank them from best to worst according to deep value + momentum principles.
3. Assign portfolio weights (in %) that sum up to 100, balancing value and momentum.
4. Present the final portfolio in the following markdown table format:

| Ticker | EV/EBIT | 12M Return | Volatility | Adj Momentum | Score | Weight (%) | Reason |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|--------------|-------|------------|--------|
| AAPL   | 6.2     | 25%        | 18%        | 1.39         | 0.82  | 25         | ...    |
...

Explain your reasoning step-by-step before showing the table.
