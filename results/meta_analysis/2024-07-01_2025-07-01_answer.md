To construct an optimal investment portfolio based on the recommendations from the five quantitative investment agents, we will follow the outlined steps systematically.

### Step 1: Analyze Consensus Stocks from Each Investment Strategy Perspective

   - **Carlisle (Momentum):** Strong upward price momentum, supported by positive market sentiment.
   - **Driehaus (Growth):** Consistent revenue and profit growth, driven by innovation and market expansion.

### Step 3: Portfolio Construction Perspective

- **Sector and Style Diversification:** The portfolio is tech-heavy but diversified across value, growth, and momentum styles.
- **Risk Dispersion Effects:** The inclusion of high-quality and efficient companies mitigates risk.
- **Correlation Analysis:** The selected stocks have varying degrees of correlation, providing some diversification benefits.

### Step 4: Final Investment Decision and Weight Allocation

Based on the analysis, the following portfolio is constructed:

| Rank | Stock | Weight(%) | # of Recommending Agents | Investment Rationale                                                                 | Key Risks                          |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1    | AAPL  | 20.0      | 5                        | Strong brand, consistent growth, high ROIC, and positive momentum                     | High valuation, market competition |
| 2    | MSFT  | 20.0      | 5                        | Robust financials, cloud growth, high ROIC, and strong momentum                       | Regulatory risks, high valuation   |
| 3    | TSLA  | 20.0      | 5                        | Market leader in EVs, high growth potential, strong momentum                          | High valuation, execution risks    |
| 4    | AMZN  | 20.0      | 5                        | Dominant in e-commerce and cloud, strong financials, and growth potential             | Regulatory risks, high valuation   |
| 5    | NVDA  | 20.0      | 5                        | Leadership in GPUs and AI, high growth potential, and strong momentum                 | High valuation, market competition |

**Total Weight:** 100%
